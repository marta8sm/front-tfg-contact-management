                Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the
                night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the
                king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The
                king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.
                And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
                jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t
                help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they
                couldn&apos;t stop.
